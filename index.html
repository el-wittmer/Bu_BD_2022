        <p>Paul et al. (1963) was published at a time when researchers were still trying to figure out the leading causes of 
            Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Paul et al. (1963) reports a multitude of findings related to CHD, and other researchers
        were able to use these findings in their own research. In this way, Paul et al. (1963) was able to influence researchers
        studying a wide variety of topics under the CHD umbrella. This slide show shows how citations accumulated over the first
        five years of Paul et al.'s (1963) publication, which topic these publications cover, and how these communities built
        around a research topic interact with other communities, if at all. </p>
